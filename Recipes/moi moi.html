        <h1>Moi-Moi(Beans Pudding)</h1>
        <p>Moi moi (also called moin moin) is a delicious, savory steamed bean pudding 
           made commonly in Nigeria from a mixture of blended black eyed peas or beans,
           peppers, onions, and spices.</p>
        <p>For an original tasteful moi moi, follow this simple steps below</p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups of black eyed peas</li>
            <li>1/2(half quantity)
                <ul>
                    <li>large bell pepper</li>
                    <li>cup neutral unflavored oil *I used sunflower oil</li>
                    <li>large onion *I used a red onion</li>
                    <li>1/4 â€“ 1/2 cup hot boiling water</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2 scotch bonnet/ habanero peppers</li>
            <li>8 oz smoked de-boned fish broken into small pieces</li>
            <li>3 tsp bouillon</li>
            <li>3 tsp salt or slat to taste</li>
            <li>3-4 broad sheet of banana leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To skin the beans, soak the beans in water for 3 minutes,
                after about 3 minutes, the skin of the beans should start
                 wrinkling a little bit.</li>
            <li>Place the beans in a food processor, with water, just
                enough to cover it, then pulse the food processor about 
                5- 6 times to agitate the beans. This process breaks the
                beans up and separates the skins from the beans. Watchout
                 for splashing water!</li>
            <li>Pour the skinned beans in a bowl. Rinse several times to
                wash off any loose skin, draining the skins with the water 
                with each rinse. The skins should come off easily because 
                the skins are lighter and should float easily to the top.</li>
            <li>Once the beans are clean, soak them in water for at least
                4 hours or over night.</li>
            <li>After the beans have soaked, drain the water that they have
                been soaking in, and rinse the beans one more time.</li>
            <li>Blend the beans with 1 cup of water, the bell pepper, 
                scotch bonnet peppers, onions and bouillon.</li>
            <li>Place the blended beans in a bowl, mix in the oil and salt 
                thoroughly then thin out the mixture with the hot water 
                until it resembles the texture of a light cake batter 
                (you may need less than 1/2 a cup of hot water, just make 
                sure the texture is like a light cake batter).</li>
            <li>Prep the ramekins by brushing each one with oil on the 
                inside like you would a cake pan. Fill each ramekin with 
                the mixture till it is about 3/4 full, and then top it 
                with a piece of fish.</li>
            <li>In a deep pot with a properly fitted pot cover, place a 
                sheet of banana leaf, and pour boiling water into the 
                pot till it is about 1 inch deep. Place the ramekins into 
                the pot, on top of the banana leaves. The hot water should 
                not be more than half way up the ramekin. Cover the ramekins 
                with a sheet of banana leaf</li>
            <li>Cover the pot, and allow it to steam on low heat for 50 minutes. 
                After 50 minutes, check the the Moi moi. Just like a cake, 
                a skewer inserted into the middle of it should come out clean. 
                If it doesn't, allow it to continue steaming for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow the Moi moi to sit for 5 minutes then serve warm in the 
                ramekin or unmolded.</li>
        </ol>
